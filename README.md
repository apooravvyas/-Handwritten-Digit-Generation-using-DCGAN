# -Handwritten-Digit-Generation-using-DCGAN
Building Generator and Discriminator Network in Python to finally generate realistic looking images using DCGAN.We cover the MNIST dataset to generate realistic hand written digits and create a custom training loop and loss functions for your GAN deep learning model

# Results
We have conducted the project with the help of MNIST database and we used the handwritten digit based database to test the architecture of generated output and considered the usage of numbers from 0 to 9 for this purpose. We train the GAN with respect to the required amount of epochs and batch normalization to gain the realistic images, given below are the figures which represents the step wise process and whenever the training number of epochs increases the more realistic images will generate.
